# MissiG (Linear Layout): Interactive Visualization of Multivarite Datasets with Missing Values

The purpose of this visualisation project to highlight the effectiveness of the novel technique, Missing Glyph for its linear layout by modifying the original design, incorporating interactivity features into the design and conducting usability test on 3 datasets with different number of variables. 

## 🚀 Description

**Motivation:** Development & researches on the visualization techniques/tools used for visualizing missing patterns on the dataset are lacking despite its critical importances for data analysis and supporting data pre-processing decisions (removal or data imputation). Furthermore, Missing Glyph visualisation is one of the techniques developed as a better alternatives to techniques like parallel coordinates and heatmaps. However, because it is still a new design, I've decided to investigate more about its effectiveness especially when the datasets used have a lot of variables in it. 

**Features: -**

* **Novel Glyph Design:** Encodes missingness patterns (AM, JM, CM) into intuitive visual components.
* **Interactive Exploration:** Features zooming, panning, and dynamic tooltips to reduce cognitive load.
* **Scalability:** Tested on datasets ranging from 6 to 22 variables.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Figma:** Used for UI/UX prototyping and layout optimization.
* **D3.js:** Core library for data-driven document manipulation and SVG rendering.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic for data preprocessing and interaction handling.
* **HTML5/CSS3:** Responsive container for the visualization dashboard.
